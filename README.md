# Student Database – Array-Based Management System

**Student Database** is a simple, array-based management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to store student details in arrays, perform searches by name or roll number, and manage add/delete operations with a clean, modern UI.

## Features

- **Add Students**
  - Enter student name, roll number, and major to add new records.
  - Records are automatically displayed in the main student table.

- **Search Functionality**
  - Search students by name or roll number.
  - The table dynamically filters to display only matching results.

- **Delete Records**
  - Remove individual students with a single click.
  - Keeps the student data organized and up-to-date.

- **Responsive UI**
  - Modern school-themed design with a professional blue and white color scheme.
  - Works on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Tech Stack
